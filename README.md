# GpsSportMap

Android application that allows the user to save data during a training session and review it later.
The idea is similar to apps like Endomundo, Nike run, Strava, etc. The app is based on Google Maps.


After the user has logged in, they can start a new session and begin tracking their movements. 
The user can also set checkpoints and waypoints during their session to measure data in smaller distances.

All the session data is saved to a database and sent to a backend Web-API/Rest service which creates a web based visualization of the map in realtime.
